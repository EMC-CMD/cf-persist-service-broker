# CF-Persistence Service Broker

###Setup
When starting the Service Broker you need to set a username and password. This is done by setting the environment variables `BROKER_USERNAME` and `BROKER_PASSWORD`.

This is an example of how we do this on CF.

 ```
 cf set-env persist BROKER_USERNAME broker
 cf set-env persist BROKER_PASSWORD broker
 ```
